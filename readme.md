## espresso bot

looks for things and save them to csv, and optionally posts them to a webhook

### define config with `pkl`:

you can define the things the bot looks up with pkl & parse it to json:

`pkl eval -f json config.pkl > config.json`

if you don't want to use `pkl` then just use `config.json`
